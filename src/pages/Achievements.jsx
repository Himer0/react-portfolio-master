        During my time at university, I've actively pursued involvement in
        various aspects of campus life. Academically, I've maintained a strong
        commitment to my studies, consistently striving to excel in my
        coursework and achieve second class upper honours. Simultaneously, I've
        also been highly engaged outside the classroom joining student clubs,
        organizations and extracurricular activities. My university years have
        been characterized by a balanced commitment to both academic excellence
        and active participation in extracurricular activities, fostering
        personal growth, and a well-rounded education.
